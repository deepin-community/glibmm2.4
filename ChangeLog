  generate_wrap_init.pl.in: Disable warning C4273

  ... for Visual Studio builds, as GLib 2.75.x and later applied
  __declspec(dllimport) via macros to DLL builds of the GLib libraries,
  meaning that when we put the GQuark and GType function prototypes into
  wrap_init.cc warning C4273 will be raised as the prototypes in
  wrap_init.cc does not have any dllimport decorations (and would not have
  otherwise mattered).
  
  This allows builds with '-Dwarnings=fatal' to proceed with Visual Studio
  builds.

  Variant: Fix so it works with C++20

  C++20 changed some aspects of templates that broke variant.h on
  some compilers (GCC 11).
  
  Ref: https://wg21.cmeerw.net/cwg/issue2237
  
    template<class T>
    struct A {
      A<T>();  // ok pre-C++20, now incorrect
  //  A();     // correct for all versions
    };
  
  This commit removes the "simple-template-id" from both the default
  constructor (no args) and the explicit constructor (has args), even
  though only the default constructor currently gives error on GCC 11.
  Since both versions are wrong according to the issue referred to above
  it is expected that GCC (and possibly other compilers) will be updated
  to fail on both cases in the future.

  Glib::Binding: Add set_manage() to not require a RefPtr

  Allow users to call Glib::manage(RefPtr<Binding>) in order to defeat our
  pre-existing and still default behaviour that a user must keep a RefPtr
  to the Binding in order to keep it alive, instead letting it revert to
  the C-style behaviour of staying alive as long as either object does.
  
  We use Glib::manage() to avoid the possible pitfall of a user calling
  ->set_manage() on the result of bind_property*(), which might be empty.
  
  This patch has been modified by Kjell Ahlstedt.
  This modified version stores the new instance data in a GQuark
  instead of new member data, which would have broken ABI.

  NMake Makefiles: Use Meson-style DLL and .lib naming if requested

  To make things more consistent and less prone to confusion, if 'USE_MESON_LIBS'
  is specified in the NMake command line, build the DLLs and .lib's that are
  named like the Meson counterparts.  Binaries built with Meson+Visual Studio
  and the ones that are built via NMake using 'USE_MESON_LIBS' are
  interchangeable, provided that they are built with the same Visual Studio
  version.

  NMake Makefiles: Fix generating [glib|gio]mm[config.h|.rc]

  This fixes the build process so that we won't need to generate them
  unnecessarily (i.e. when building from a release tarball built with autotools).
  
  Also streamline the build process that we no longer need to explicitly run
  the 'prep-git-build' target before building, where we generate
  [glib|gio]mm[config.h|.rc], and if needed, gmmproc and generate_wrap_init.pl,
  as part of the normal 'all' target if necessary

  docs/reference/: Update for Doxygen >= 1.8.16

  * docs/reference/meson.build: Doxygen 1.8.16 and later does not store
  tag file names in the html files. This requires changes in meson.build
  and in doc-install.pl (in mm-common). Otherwise references to other modules
  won't be updated in the html files when they are installed.
  * docs/reference/Doxyfile.in: Remove PERL_PATH and MSCGEN_PATH.
  Doxygen since version 1.8.0 does not use them.

  Meson/Visual Studio builds: Include toolset version by default

  This makes the built DLL and .lib's contain the toolset version if the build is
  carried out using Visual Studio 2015 or later, unless the
  'msvc14x-parallel-installable' option is set to be false during configuration.
  
  The reasoning behind this change is that there are subtle problems when, for
  instance, one tries to link to a Visual Studio 2015-built glibmm when building
  gtkmm and libxml++ with Visual Studio 2017 or 2019.  This is unfortunate as
  Microsoft did try hard to make interoperating between binaries built with
  Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 as easy as possible in terms of ABI and API,
  but unfortunately this hits the corner cases where this compatibility does not
  work.
  
  As the name suggests, this attempts to make Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019
  builds share a single set of underlying C DLLs easier, while avoiding breakages
  caused by such subtle differences.

  NMake Makefiles: Clean up building tests and examples

  Instead of hand-written rules, just make use of what we have to generate the
  rules on the fly for most of the tests and examples, since the rules are more
  or less the same for each of the test and example programs.  We only need to
  single-out the ones that aren't buildable under Windows and those that have
  multiple programs under each directory, as opposed to one example/test program
  per directory.
  
  Even for those directories that have multiple example programs, we can pretty
  easily generate the rules for them.
  
  Also remove repeated parts that were added by accident.
  
  This can shrink the NMake Makefiles by a bit.

  glib/glibmm/ustring.h: Fix building on Visual Studio 2015

2020-06-12  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Update README.win32

  Let people know that it is recommended (and even required at some
  points) to use the same Visual Studio version for building glibmm and
  dependent software, even for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.

2020-06-12  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Distinguish between MSVC 2015, 2017 and 2019

  It was found that we cannot rely on the fact that Visual Studio
  2015~2019 tried very hard to be binary compatible, as there are corner
  cases when linking against glibmm built with Visual Studio 2015 with
  builds done by Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 where the code will fail to
  link and the DLLs are therefore not ABI-compatible.  Note that the
  libsigc++ DLLs, however, are ABI compatible between these 3 Visual
  Studio versions.
  
  As a result, for the DLL and LIB names, use 'vc140' for Visual Studio
  2015 builds, 'vc141' for Visual Studio 2017 builds and 'vc142' for
  Visual Studio 2019 builds, according to the toolset versions as defined
  by Microsoft.
  
  For people that may have previously built glibmm with Visual Studio 2017
  or 2019, which had 'vc140' in the built .lib and DLL, an NMake option
  'USE_COMPAT_LIBS' is added to make building such binaries with 'vc140'
  easier, if needed.

  propertyproxy_base: Fix using notify w/o prop name

  GLib has now specified that if you want to connect to a signal without a
  detail argument, you omit the `::`. So, glibmm users previously
  connecting to `notify::` to listen for changes to all properties broke.
  Fix that by only passing `notify` i.e. no superfluous `::` in that case.

  Bump version

  glibmm: Update glibmmconfig.h.[in|meson] for MSVC

  Drop all the compatibility bits for Visual Studio 2013 as Visual Studio

  Make sure that we do enable GLIBMM_CAN_USE_THREAD_LOCAL as Visual Studio
  2015 or later has thread_local, but we must also ensure that we do not
  mark DispatcherNotifier for export as a result, since thread_local
  conflicts with __declspec(dllexport).
  
  Also update for Visual Studio 2017+ as the compiler does allow static
  members to be initialized inline to std::string::npos
  (GLIBMM_HAVE_ALLOWS_STATIC_INLINE_NPOS), but use a work
  around for pre-Visual Studio 2017 so that we do not get a linker error

  build of glibmm) on Visual Studio.
  
  Also, for the meson builds, disable warnings 4251 and 4275 as they all relate
  to building DLLs regarding symbol export, which is harmless as we know clearly
  that we are indeed building DLLs in our case, and we have already set
  GLIBMM_API appropriately

  share the same CRTs, let them all use the PDB version (v14) as binaries
  in this case should be interchangeable.  For Visual Studio 2013, the PDB
  version is the same as VSVER (v12), so 2013 builds will remain separate.

  NMake Makefiles: build glibmm_generate_extra_defs-2.4.lib

  Since this is entirely buildable by Visual Studio, build it as well and see
  whether we can use this to allow builds from GIT checkouts for other -mm
  libraries with MSVC builds.
  
  Copy this .lib and its header upon 'install'.

  MSVC_NMake/config-msvc.mak: Correct libsigc++ libname

  'sigc-2.0.lib', like the autotools builds, so correct the library name
  here.

  Variant: Avoid . to not split an intro doc comment

  Doxygen interprets the first . to mean the end of the introductory
  blurb, so that resulted in this sentence suddenly ending after the "i."
  in "i.e." in the short version and having a line break there in the long

  NMake: Split outdir by toolset version

  This reduces the likelihood of accidently mixing binaries linked against

  NMake Makefiles: Use /utf-8 where available

  This avoids miscompilations under certain locales (Chinese, Japanese and
  Korean in particular) where Unicode sequences are not properly handled
  by the Visual Studio compiler.

  NMake Makefiles: Add USE_MESON_LIBS

  Glib::Binding: Explain why SlotTransform takes GValue*

  Fixes #61

2019-11-09  Daniel Boles  <dboles.src@gmail.com>

  Binding: no point to set target value if got false

  If we return false, GBinding ignores target GValue, so there’s no point
  setting it. Besides, if the transform function returned false, that says
  they couldn't calculate a target value, so they shouldn’t assign to `to`
  
  I default-construct primitive `T_to`s in case anyone *was* reading those
  for some daft reason, so they get a zero-initialised value instead of UB

  Binding: Move SlotTypeTransform up and document it

  This is more maintainable than all the arguments to all the overloads of

  Glib::Property: Update for compatibility with Gtk::Builder

  When an object is created by GtkBuilder, the GObject-derived C object is
  created and its properties set before there is a C++ wrapper to store
  the property values in. Glib::custom_set_property_callback() stores
  property values in a data structure reached via a GQuark in the object.
  PropertyBase::lookup_property() copies those property values to the
  PropertyBase objects when the C++ wrapper is created.

  Gio::SocketControlMessage: Add add_deserialize_func()

  The deserialize vfunc in GLib is a class virtual function (not associated
  with an instance). Such functions don't exist in C++. But it must be wrapped
  in one way or another. g_socket_control_message_deserialize() assumes that
  all subclasses of GSocketControlMessage override this vfunc. A user-program
  can crash, if any subclass does not.
  
  This patch adds API by adding code from the master branch. Fixes #52
